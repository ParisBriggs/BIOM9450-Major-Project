BIOM9450 Major Project

A Web-Based Medication and Diet Regime Management Platform

Platform process:
1. A practitioner logs onto the system
2. A medications round (morning, afternoon or evening) for a particular day is selected.
3. A diet regime round (morning, afternoon or evening) for a particular day is also selected.
4. A patient is selected from a list (possibly also displaying their picture).
5. Each medication and the diet regime menu for this patient is viewed and prepared and the medication
name, dosage, route of administration (as a minimum) are displayed. A set of rules about food,
exercise, or beauty in the diet regime menu are also displayed. The practitioner dispenses and
acknowledges delivery of EACH medication and the diet regime for the patient. Medications do not
always have to be given, so the system should record such options as: given, refused, fasting, no
stock, ceased. The system should also naturally record the name of the dispensing practitioner. If the
medication for a patient is refused, the system should send an email to the aged-care facilityâ€™s director
with patient ID and practitioner name.
6. Step 4 is repeated for each medication and diet regime for this patient.
7. Steps 3-5 are repeated for all patients in the facility for which the practitioner is caring.
